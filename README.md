<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About

### How to Typing Test

This is a minimalistic, yet sleek design of a typing speed test. I counts the words per minute (wpm) typed, the accuracy rate, and it saves high scores in the user's
browser via the localStorage function. This is a simple React page with Redux and a few animations, with a lot of room for improvement. Feel free to contribute.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

# Getting Started

## Requirements

-   [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
    -   You'll know you did it right if you can run `git --version` and you see a response like `git version x.x.x`
-   [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/)
    -   You'll know you've installed nodejs right if you can run:
        -   `node --version`and get an ouput like: `vx.x.x`
-   [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/) instead of `npm`
    -   You'll know you've installed yarn right if you can run:

        -   You might need to install it with npm
